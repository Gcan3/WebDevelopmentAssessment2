        <p class="text1">
          Developing a website is one of the current subjects I'm
          studying in the University of BathSpa UAE. Web development is an important aspect when it comes
          to learning a creative computing skill. Not only does it help me to be creative in developing websites, 
          but it also helps me to fully understand the major concepts of websites.
        </p>
        <img src="media/html.jpg" alt="html" class="img2">
        <p class="text1">
        HTML, short term for hyper text markup language, is one of the main blocks to making a website. While it does not
        include the styles and designs for its own elements, it acts as the foundation for all the elements used in the website.
        In fact, without HTML, there is no website.
        </p>
        <img src="media/css.jpg" alt="css" class="img2">
        <p class="text1">
          CSS, cascading style sheet, is another block of code that deals purely with the design and styles of the website. Without it,
          the website will become crunched together and cannot look as intended as what the coder visualizes. In addition to the stylesheet,
          animation effects.
        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          Javascript is one of the front-end developments to the website as it gives functioning features that are not present in both HTML and CSS.
          It deals with a more original and basic coding structure which is also easy to understand. Like the "back to top" button, the javascript
          allows the website to have more user interaction.

        <h3 class="text1"> Digital Design</h3>
        <!--Section contents-->
        <p class="text1">
          In this subject, I study and learn the concepts of designing. The focus is towards the concept of building a <i>wireframe</i>. Figma is
          a great tool for making such wireframes.
        </p>

        <img src="media/Figma-logo.png" alt="figma" class="img2" usemap="#figma">

        <p class="text1">
          While the subject mostly lean towards digital designing as per its name, the subject also teaches about the rules and techniques
          to making a good product design. After all, we cannot afford to make such bad designs.
        </p>

          Ideation and Creative Problem Solving
        </h3>

        <!--Section contents-->
        <p class="text1">
          This subject is more towards the individual's way of thinking rather than learning the technical skills of computers.
          It introduces many ways to solve a problem and come up with original ideas. They are called ideation techniques and it helps
          to become more creative in nature. The activities held in this subject are mostly in groups or duos.
        </p>

        <img src="media/bulb.jpg" alt="bulb" class="img2">

        <p class="text1">
          Building on another's work, worst ideas, improvisation, and creative intuition are some of the skills used for creative problem
          solving.
