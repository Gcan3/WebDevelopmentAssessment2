          My name is Gabriel S. Cantiga. I'm mostly referred to as Gab.
          I was born in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and mostly grew
          up in the United Arab Emirates. Coincidentally, I was born
          a day ahead of the UAE's national day. In which case, I
          could celebrate my birthday during the holidays.

          Although I was born and grew up in the Middle East,
          my nationality is purely Filipino. I can speak up to
          two languages (english and tagalog) and still getting
          to know more. I sometimes visit my country on vacations
          from courseworks. But overall, I have mostly seen and
          understand the cultures and societies in the Middle East.

          My Hobbies

          I actually don't do hobbies as often as usual. I 
          mostly commit myself to important courseworks first
          then I do anything I like to do. 
        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          My favorite hobby is playing basketball outdoors. 
          I used to play with a ball as a child and loved it.
          Basketball was a fun physical activity especially since
          I could throw the ball into a goal (which felt satisfying).
          Nowadays, I just do rounds of dribbling moves to improve my
          basketball skills.
        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          Mobile gaming is another thing I love doing. 
          Though it may be less fun than playing it at the PC,
          I find mobile games very comfortable to play as it is
          portable. Furthermore, I grew up having a small and compact
          gaming devices such as the old Gameboy and PSP.

        <p class="text1">
          Going on trips with my family happens sometimes but those
          experiences tend to come at its best. For example, Jebel Jais is
          on of UAE's highest mountain peaks. <i>My photo above shows the view from
          the mountains</i>
