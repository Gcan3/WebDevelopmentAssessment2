          My Thoughts

        <p class="text1">
          In the case of my studies, I have learned many things and completed numerous works. Mathematics is 
          one of my main fortes when it comes to my basic education. However, in the nature of professional work,
          computer technology is an advancement to my knowledge as the world is starting to shift through the 
          technological generation.

          Furthermore, most if not all the fields of knowledge have started relying on technology and its machinery.
          Biological science, for example, depends on the machines to act as a tool for research and experiments. Thus that is how
          biotechnology came about.

          The Difficulties

        <p class="text1">
          Every path and goal we take on, there is always an obstacle waiting for us to overcome.
          Obstacles could alternate our nature such as the way we think. However, we ought to strive over them 
          no matter how difficult it is. We solve such problems with the knowledge we experienced along the way. 
        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          My experience in learning technology is no different. For someone who has almost no experience with
          programming, I can overcome the struggle using the things I have learned throughout my life. Logic is one of those skills
          that I have with me to keep up with the things I am learning.

          The workforce nowadays must at least have an experience of technology as it tends to revolutionize
          various types of jobs. All of the things I learned throughout the computing creativity course meets the standard
          requirements for those various jobs. It helps me to apply basic fundamentals into certain fields where programming
          and computing is needed.
        </p>

        <p class="text1">
          Technical skills are not the only things that can be applied from the courseworks. The creativity of an individual
          becomes a unique skill that can be utilized in labor.
